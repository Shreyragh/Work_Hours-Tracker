# Work Hours Tracker - Setup Instructions

## Current Status
Your project is already partially configured and the development server is running on http://localhost:3001

## What we've done so far:
1. ✅ Added missing environment variables to `.env.local`
2. ✅ Installed dependencies with `pnpm install`
3. ✅ Created database setup script

## Next Steps to Complete Setup:

### 1. Set up Supabase Database
The login issue you're experiencing is likely due to missing database tables. You need to run the SQL script to create all required tables.

**Go to your Supabase Dashboard:**
1. Visit https://supabase.com/dashboard
2. Select your project: `oamgyflffgixaynwddsq`
3. Go to "SQL Editor" in the left sidebar
4. Copy and paste the entire content from `database-setup.sql`
5. Click "Run" to execute the script

This will create:
- `user_profiles` table for user information
- `work_logs` table for tracking work sessions  
- `clock_sessions` table for clock in/out functionality
- `organisations` table for company management
- All necessary triggers, policies, and functions

### 2. Test the Application
After running the database setup:

1. **Sign Up**: Go to http://localhost:3001/signup and create a new account
2. **Complete Onboarding**: You'll be redirected to set up your profile
3. **Start Using**: After onboarding, you can start tracking time!

### 3. Key Features Available:
- **Time Tracker**: Clock in/out functionality
- **Work Logs**: Manual time entry and editing
- **Dashboard**: Overview of your work hours
- **Reports**: Analytics and insights
- **Account Settings**: Manage your profile and preferences

## Troubleshooting:

### If login still doesn't work:
1. Check browser console for errors (F12)
2. Verify the database script ran without errors
3. Try creating a new account instead of logging in

### If you get database connection errors:
1. Double-check your Supabase URL and anon key in `.env.local`
2. Make sure your Supabase project is active
3. Check if Row Level Security policies are properly set

### Development Commands:
- `pnpm dev` - Start development server
- `pnpm build` - Build for production
- `pnpm start` - Start production server
- `pnpm lint` - Run linting

## Project Structure:
- `/src/app` - Next.js app router pages
- `/src/components` - Reusable UI components
- `/src/actions` - Server actions for database operations
- `/src/lib/supabase` - Supabase client configuration
- `/src/types` - TypeScript type definitions

## Need Help?
The main issue you mentioned (getting stuck on login page) should be resolved once you run the database setup script. The application expects users to have completed onboarding before accessing protected routes.
